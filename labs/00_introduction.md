Jenkins Pipeline Techlab
========================

In the following guided and hands-on techlab we show the participants how to work, write and use Jenkins Pipelines.
If you did not already see the slides please have a look at them under: [Slides](https://puzzle.github.io/jenkins-techlab/#/)

We mainly focus on multi-branch pipelines, which are a basic concept behind a continuous integration and delivery workflow.

If you find errors, bugs or missing information please help us to improve our techlab and [contribute](../CONTRIBUTING.md) pull-requests and issues.
